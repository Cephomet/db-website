## Responsibility
Please respect Github's rules, while the theme of this repo can be adult in language sometimes, all image content must be non-pornographic and educational. This repo is purely for educational safety, guides for those in the DB community. Please respect when contributing.

## Contributing
This project runs off Hugo, using the theme Dok. All of the articles are written in markdown and located in the folder content/en/docs/. For new articles, new folder must be created and follow same format as other folders, images used in that article must be placed inside that folder. Currently we are only looking for additions/feedback on EXISTING articles until better system is made.
