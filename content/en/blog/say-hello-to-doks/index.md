## Article New

Several articles have been updated. They are still in draft, so expect changes to them in the future. I plan to add many images to help assist people who are visual learners. I am currently working on bunch of custom images/infographics for people that I think will help a lot.

## BDSM Kink List

Will be updated in the future, currently it still works at https://kinklist.deviantbound.com/

## More Things To Come..
Stay tuned.
