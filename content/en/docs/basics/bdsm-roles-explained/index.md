## What do the three roles mean in BDSM?

In BDSM, there are three primary roles:

- `Submissives`
- `Dominants`
- `Switche`

Roles describe a person’s interest in BDSM. Many shorten the terms into prefixes like dom, sub and switch. The roles describe the dynamic a person is interested in and the kinks they may enjoy. In short, enjoying the feeling of power over a sub is a dominant quality. While enjoying the submission to a dominant is submissive quality. For those who enjoy both sides, they are referred to as switches.

**Tip:** You may hear the term “vanilla”. This is used to describe people who are not involved/slightly involved in BDSM and are “vanilla” in their sexual / kink interest. This means they are not kinky, or not involved in the BDSM community.

## Do I need to know if I am a Dom, Sub, or Switch?

Yes! Role dynamics are pivotal to having a good experience in BDSM. Roles determine what kind of individuals will be more inclined to interact with you. Knowing your role can also help with gaining a better understanding of yourself and what you like. It will help you partner understand your preferences and boundaries. Remember that you know yourself better than anyone else!
If you're uncertain of your role, you can use the BDSM test at the bottom of this site once you get done reading this guide. There is no right or wrong role and your role may even change in time as you become more exposed to various kinks and even people.

## The Switch Struggle

Being a switch yourself, or looking to enter a dynamic with one can be challenging if you are not a switch yourself too. Unlike a dominant or submissive, a switch can fit their partner's needs or change as they feel. This can create issues if one partner reconize themselves as one role only, like a submissive. Before diving in with a switch, it is a good idea to have a conversation that everyone accept each other's boundaries, not to Dom/sub. If one is open to the idea in the future of exploring switch life, consider expressing that too. Being clear early on is important when looking to be with a switch.

Many switches can stay in one headspace for the whole of the dynamic and are comfortable with that, but others times it can become an issue.

## Slang & Inferring Meaning

There are multiple phrases/words that imply a gender or kinks to a word used to describe someone. For example, Domme is specifically used for female dominants, whereas "daddy" refers to a male dominant. You can often assume a person's leaning by the kinks they are interested in. Someone who calls themselves a daddy is not going to be a submissive, though they could potentially be a switch. Whenever in doubt, be sure to ask questions!

## Are Doms Absolute & Subs Powerless?

No! Your roles are just a framework to express what makes you deviant, and not rules to live by. If something feels not right, then stop. BDSM is meant to be enjoyed, even if you are a submissive you have a voice to say stop, and you should. Any dominant worth their salt will respect your concerns and lookout for your safety. Safe words are a great way to go about this (they will be discussed more later).
