## Starting Your Journey

You must think to yourself, what do you want out of BDSM? If you have a certain picture in your head, find out what kinks that involve and start seeing what exists out there for you. If you are unsure what kinks even exist checkout our kink list https://kinklist.deviantbound.com/ and google some. Once you have your goals, express them when meeting others. By finding your BDSM Role and the kinks that interest you, you will be able to paint the picture of who you are to others, allowing you to find the right people that will mesh with what you want out of BDSM. Your role is by far one of the most significant things in determining what doors it will open for you. As you dive deeper you may find your role changes, or your kinks change, and that is all part of the journey.

## Online Journey

There are many great blogs, forums, and communities out there for BDSM. Due to BDSM being represented as sexual sometimes, it is often against TOS of many social media services because of porn etc... this can make it problematic to find a safe place to run a BDSM community online without being banned. Our community with ~1000+ members exists on Discord and is public to join https://join.devinantbound.com. Discord has fairly modest rules regarding sexual content, making it a safe place. Even if you don't not find what you seek in our community, there are countless others to consider too on Discord.

## Local Community

The most accessible way to see what exists for BDSM in your community is through sites like fetlife.com, which let you search for events based in your area. This can be a great way to make connections with people. Fetlife specifically, lets you see who is attending, so you can decide if it's a vibe you like or not by checking people's profiles first.

Consider googling your local city/state and see if websites exist for munches, dungeons and BDSM events/education. Due to the nature of BDSM, much of the scene is not public and requires being involved already in your community, if you don't see anything that is sometimes to be expected. Fetlife is the recommended path to get involved for beginners if you seek getting deeper into your local BDSM community. That said, you don't have to formally join BDSM local events, many practice BDSM with their own partners pushing/learning together when starting out and that is totally acceptable/common as well.
