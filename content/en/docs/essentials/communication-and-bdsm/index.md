## Communication

Having the ability and space to communicate is as essential as being an effective listener with open ears, this is the foundation in BDSM you should strive for in your dynamic. Not all communication is equal, good communication is about improving the situation together, not dividing yourselves further. It can be challenging to listen to a partner's issue, and for many it can be equally challenging to vocalize concerns. Learn each other and if something seems off, ask. Consider taking it to a higher level and put time aside to review what things works, or what things didn't, be proactive for next week. Good communication should be a constant focus in your dynamic, do not give up on it, because when you do is when it bites.

### Tips On Communication

Think deeply about what you are upset/wanting to communicate about. You often run into not liking one thing, when in reality it's another thing that the deeper issue. Approach the issue at it's root and prepare your thoughts, perhaps write up a note with bullet points you want to express if that would help. Getting tripped, especially with those you care about, is not uncommon. As humans, we tend to be adverse to friction, but it is a needed trade-off to help our dynamics stay healthy! Do not ignore conflict, rather learn its presence is a warning to communicate better.

Remember, BDSM is a journey with no guide. Seek what you want from it and be honest to others, and most importantly yourself.

## Honorifics

It is the term for the names you call your partner, or in some cases submissives. It is meant to imply you are honoring them through its use as a power dynamic, but also loosely it means "the name you call your partner" meaning it implies to submissives as well. The types of honorifics will vary from the kinks you partake in, usually, it's decided by the Dominant who has their own preference based on what kinks they enjoy. Honorifics can be kink-specific like master or daddy, but they can be ambiguous like sir. Whereas submissive can be called baby or darling, for example.

## Know Yourself

One challenge if you are BDSM is finding your voice and what you want from it. If you go in thinking apples, but want  carrots, you are going to have a hard time. There is no expectation you should 100% know yourself, but it's something we should all strive towards. Knowing ourselves on a deeper level helps support healthy friendships and relationships with others.

## Setting Dynamic Goals

As a connection evolves, you should establish answers to some of these important questions. Communicating your goals and expectations before things get going is the best way to avoid systemic issues further down the road.

- Is this casual, or are we dating with long-term goals?
- Are we exclusive?
- Are we online only or IRL.
- Doing photos, video, voice, in person?
- What kind of dynamic are you looking for?
Do not fall prey to an ambiguous dynamics where questions like these are left unanswered. The leading cause of friction and other negative dynamics stem from misaligned goals. Ensuring each other are on the same page (and honest about it) is essential.

## Dynamics Change

You may discover what you, or your partner, likes changes. It can be new kinks, new limits, other times some may discover an entire different role. Communicating interests is an essential, confessing what works for you and what does not goes both ways.
