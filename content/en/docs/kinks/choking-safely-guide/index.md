Imagery of choking is a popular depiction in mainstream media in dominant/submissive dynamics, though the practice of choking is much more involved than it appears on the outside. Restraining someone down by their throat, or applying a slight grip is nothing new and can be done with realtive safety if you mind your grip strength and your partner. The physical act of holding someone's throat or evne applying pressure on their throat does not imply choking, many may not even consider the above choking in their words. Choking is term used for someone who is unable to recieve oxygen to their brain, due to an obstruction with their throat. You may hear terms like breath-play, where partner is intentially meant to feel the effects of losing oxygen to their brain for a europhoic feel.

Breath play is closely related to choking, it consist of any acitivity that blocks a person's blood flow OR air flow. Blood is what carries oxygen to the brain wheras breathing is how oyxgen is supplied to the blood. If either of these bodily systems are interupted, then asphyxiation occurs. Term asphyxiation specifically related to oxygen supply in your blood, wheras choking refers to throat obstructions. In breath play choking is main method of inducing the feeling of asphyxiation, the feeling is desired because of the light headed feeling and adrenaline/euphoric sensation it gives when practiced.

Important to reconzie many are misinformed about choking in BDSM, in a vanilla sense many "choke" their partner without ever inducing asphyxiation. This can create a false sense of expections for people who simply expect to have hand on their throat. For this reason you should differenate between breath play and choking and what they are comfortable with, as not everyone's knowedalge and comfort level is the same. Choking can be seen as vanilla by some, but other times completely the opsitite for those who love breath-play.

The practice is choking someone is dangerous, the throat's cartilage is fragile and the bloodflow around the throat is essential to life. Listen to your partner and their well-being is paramount. As a general rule you do not want to put your pressure on the oesophagus, which is the tube found front face, below your chin that carries food to your stomach. The oesophagus is vurnable to damage and cna become ruptured, it is far more risker to try to block than safer means like the carotid arteries. The best practice is to apply pressure on the SIDES of the throat, this will block oxygen and is far more safer than obstructing the oesophagus.

Useful Tip: If you are ever sick and have a stuffy nose, you can intentially induce asphyxiation upon yourself (make sure you are not alone) to active your bodies flight or flight system which will restrict blood vessles, thus quickly reduce imflation in your nose. Allowing you to blow your nose and clear it. Simply exhale all the air in your longs and hold your breath and nose closed for as long as you can until you feel it work.
