## Important Concepts

BDSM is something private between you and your consenting partner. Should not be something you outwardly display or act in a way that causes the non-consenting public to be aware of your dynamic BDSM. Consent is important to all those around if they are present to see it. For example, if you host an event at home and your partner is an exhibitionist, receiving consent or explaining the event in detail for those attending before the event is highly important.

Some unfortunately, go about BDSM openly in the public (like at stores) for all ages and people to witness. At best this is disturbing to non-consenting strangers around you, at worst it can carry criminal penalties. This is often glamorized  in porn and should not be something you do with a partner, despite what you may see.

### Humiliation

It is not necessarily exhibition (which is gratifying to yourself), but for some it can be. Humiliation is usually a punishment, forcing someone to do something publicly, often that can be sexually charged in nature. Often finding itself closely related to exhibitionism as a kink.

There are many great ways to have a BDSM experience out in public without the visible nature if humiliation is your goal. Some incognito ideas

Cages / Chastity devices
Insertable plugs (not to be confused with remote vibrators!)
Panties (feminization)
Chest/Leg harness with rope underclothing (use very thin rope, width will vary on body/clothing styles).
Changing username/profile/about me (online).
Write messages/names on one's body.

## Hidden Language

Openly communicating about BDSM is less than ideal when out in public. The idea of nonverbal language is not necessarily BDSM only, it is great for communicating things without verbal use. Style and complexity will vary based off what your needs of the dynamic are. Some examples below give an idea of how you can use non-verbal language to bring attention to concerns/express feelings that otherwise are can not be discussed openly with words. Find what works for your own dynamic.

- Tug on your ear – This can represent listen to me for a Dom or a Sub.
- Rub Palm On Your Ear – Could represent be quiet or hide what is going on.
- Run your hand through your hair – Could mean disregard last thing if you do an action by accident.
- Three taps on the hand or leg – Could mean how are you doing?
- Thumb itching nose – Could mean I am great, keep going.
- Pointer finger, itching nose – Calm it down a tiny bit.
- Both hands (fingertips) rubbing side of your nose towards your eyes – Could mean you are feeling overwhelmed.
- Squeezing a wrist – A safe motion, meaning stop everything and talk to me when safe.
- Pointer finger+thumb on the chin rubbing it – A safe motion meaning stop everything and talk to me when safe.
